OpenCAMLib README

1. INTRODUCTION
OpenCAMLib (ocl) is a c++ library for creating toolpaths for cnc-machines
such as mills and lathes.

The project is hosted at
http://code.google.com/p/opencamlib/

The mailing-list for general development and user-discussion is:
http://groups.google.com/group/opencamlib

SVN commit messages go to a mailing-list:
http://groups.google.com/group/opencamlib-svn

IRC-channel #cam on irc.freenode.net

It's probably a good idea to try to adhere to some coding standard. Maybe this one:

2. BUILDING and INSTALLING (on unix/debian-like systems)
cd into the /src directory, then run
 $> cmake .
this creates a Makefile, and build with
 $> make 
this should create the ocl library as a file "ocl.so" in the /src directory
 $> sudo make install
will install the ocl.so library and camvtk.py so that any python shell will find them.

 
if you also want to build the documentation, then run
 $> make doc
and
 $> make doc-pdf
this should create the ocl manual named "ocl-manual.pdf" in the src/doc directory

3. ORGANIZATION OF FILES
(generate this with 'tree -dL 2')

.
|-- cpp_examples                c++ example use of opencamlib
|   `-- point                   minimal example of ocl::Point
|-- debian                      files for building a debian package
|-- lib                         useful python libraries
|-- scripts                     python scripts that test or demonstrate use of ocl
|   |-- issues                  scripts that relate to issues on google-code
|   `-- offset-ellipse          offset-ellipse examples
|-- src                         source root dir, python-bindings        
|   |-- algo                    algorithms
|   |-- attic                   old source files and experimental unused code
|   |-- cutsim                  cutting simulation
|   |-- cutters                 cutter-classes
|   |-- doc                     documentation
|   `-- geo                     primitive geometry classes (point,triangle,stlsurf, etc.)
|-- stl                         STL files for testing
`-- Windows                     Visual-studio project for building on windows

the Id svn keyword is set like this:
svn propset svn:keywords 'Id' filename.cpp 


3. Ubuntu 10.04LTS install and build
- install 64-bit Ubuntu 10.04LTS
- run update manager and install all suggested updates. reboot.
- using synaptic or apt-get, install the following packages(and their dependencies)
-- build-essential
-- cmake
-- subversion
-- doxygen
-- texlive-latex-base
-- libboost1.40-all-dev
- checkout ocl from svn
-- instructions: http://code.google.com/p/opencamlib/source/checkout
- in the /src directory, first run "cmake ." then "make" and then "sudo make install"
-- this should build and install ocl correctly.
